Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        a block element starts on a new line and covers as much of the width of the screen as it can. an inline element starts on the same line and only takes up the space it needs.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
       It's position becomes relative to the edges of the ancestor  element.  
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
        You could make it an inline element give it the style "display: inline-block" then give it a width style.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        <div>, <h1>, <section> || <span>, <img> || <button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
        it's a box. well, it just means that an element has a few set border attributes you can apply styles to. They are arranged like a box with each part being a different 'layer' to the box. You can edit the margin, border, padding, and the sizes of each of these. if you don't specify which to edit, the center 'box' with be styled.
        You can use the box-sizing property to limit the element's size including the borders (border-box) or not including the borders (content-box). This makes it a little easier to size elements within other elements.
